## I keep encountering claiming errors. What should I do?

If you receive an error, try closing your browser and starting the process again. If the error persists, you may [manually mint and claim your ZK tokens](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zknation-data/blob/main/README.md).

## Can multi-sig wallets (e.g. SAFE) claim ZK tokens?

ZK tokens allocated to multi-sig wallets on L1 and L2 cannot be used on claim.zknation.io. To mint/claim the ZK tokens from the ZKsync airdrop from a multi-sig, please follow the [instructions for manual claiming](https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zknation-data/blob/main/README.md).

## Can I manually claim my ZK tokens?

## I am eligible for allocations that are distributed at different dates. How do I claim each of them?

Some addresses can be eligible to claim allocations are different times. For example, the user airdrop and the project contributor airdrop have two different claim dates. To claim at multiple dates, at the end of the claims process, users will see a link to start the claim process for the next allocation. Alternatively, if they reload the screen and recheck eligibility, they will see their eligibility for the next airdrop.

## Can I still claim airdrop tokens if I missed the 3rd January 2025 claim window deadline?

After the claim window closes, it is no longer possible to claim the airdrop.

## What happens to tokens that are not claimed during the airdrop window?

As the airdrop tokens were not minted, any unclaimed ZK from the airdrop will be added to the balance of total mintable supply under the control of the [Token Assembly](https://docs.zknation.io/zksync-governance/zksync-governance-procedures-overview#id-4.-governance-bodies). These tokens can be distributed via governance on the [Token Governor](https://docs.zknation.io/zksync-governance/schedule-1-standard-governance-procedures#id-4.-token-governor).&#x20;
