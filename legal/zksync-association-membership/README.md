# ZKsync Association

The ZKsync Association is a non-profit association established under Austrian law to enhance digital literacy and empower all members of society with the skills and knowledge to understand the blockchain and digital economy with focus on (i) cryptography, especially in the field of zero knowledge, and (ii) blockchain-based networks, systems, architectures, applications and products, particularly those involving zero-knowledge and/or artificial intelligence, and promote the development and dissemination of such knowledge. Through this mandate, the ZKsync Association supports, promotes, and helps develop ZKsync’s protocol token and its governance system.&#x20;

The ZKsync Association is also the home to the ZKsync Governance Team. This team maintains infrastructure and resources for blockchain governance operations, oversees the system design and updates, educates the ZK-Community as well as the public on decentralized governance, blockchain technology (in particular in the realm of zero knowledge proofs), and ensures that processes aligns with ZKsync’s core principles.
