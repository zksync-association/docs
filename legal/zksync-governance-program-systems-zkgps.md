# ZKsync Governance Program Systems (ZKGPS)

### What is ZKGPS?

ZKsync Governance Program Systems (ZKGPS) is an ownerless Cayman Foundation responsible for the administration and execution of Token Program Proposals approved by ZKsync Governance.

The purpose of ZKGPS is to:

1. **Enter legal contracts in service of the Token Assembly:** ZKGPS contracts with service providers and/or program participants, creating a legal obligation between service providers and proposal participants to act as prescribed in the specification of the relevant governance proposal.
   * Program Administrators (minter admins / multisig signers / veto executors)
   * Service Providers/Vendors for proposal operations (service agreements)
2. **Ensure KYC/KYB Compliance:** Perform KYC/KYB on individuals and entities who receive ZK tokens through governance proposals (excluding users).

The ZKsync Governance Team will work closely with the Director of ZKGPS to connect proposal authors, multisig signers and service providers with ZKGPS in order to complete KYC and coordinate contracts.

ZKGPS was established on October 24th 2024.The bylaws for ZKGPS can be found [here](attachment:3356e865-0674-4c3c-b9b4-25a6a624aade:ZKsync_Governance_Program_Systems_Amended_Memorandum_and_Articles.pdf).

### Engaging with ZKGPS

Any participant likely to receive ZK tokens in exchange for services provided as part of a Token Program recipient of ZK through a Token Assembly approved Token Program will be required to contract with ZKGPS and complete KYC/KYB.

The ZKsync Governance Team can help support getting in touch with ZKGPS.

Contracts related to a given Token Program Proposal will not take effect until the relevant proposal has been executed onchain.

To prevent delays following proposal execution, participants likely to contract with GPS will be contacted and asked to complete KYC/KYB prior to onchain proposal execution.
