# ZKsync Association Membership

## Membership Information for the ZKsync Association

### 1. General information&#x20;

The ZKsync Association is an association under the laws of Austria, with its corporate seat in Vienna ("Association"). The Association is a voluntary, permanent establishment for the pursuit of the direct and indirect promotion, development, and support of the ZKsync blockchain protocol, the surrounding community, and its ecosystem.&#x20;

### 2. Association Membership

2.1 Active delegates can become members of the Association.

2.2 Membership in the Association is open to all delegates of ZKsync Governance who have received delegated voting power from ZK tokenholders  ("Delegates"). Delegates who opt-in to membership become members of the Association Token Assembly ("ATA"), which is a body of the Association.&#x20;

2.3 By submitting a proposal or voting on a proposal through the Association’s ZKsync governance interface at www.zknation.io (the  “Portal”) a Delegate agrees to join the Association as a member prior to submitting a proposal or vote. Delegates may actively decide to not become members of the Association during the voting process (by selecting the appropriate check-box). For a limited period, the Portal of the Association will also be available for non-members to participate in the voting process to ensure the initial adoption of ZKsync.&#x20;

### 3. Rights, obligations & benefits of extraordinary members

3.1 As members of the ATA, extraordinary members can form the will and opinion of the Association with regard to the further development of the ZKsync protocol.

3.2 In their role as a member of the ATA, members have the following rights and obligations:

(a) the right to submit ZKsync governance proposals via the Portal (subject to certain voting power thresholds),

(b) the right to vote on such ZKsync governance proposals via the Portal (subject to certain voting power thresholds),

(c) right to veto proposed Board members (up to three cycles of vetoes),

(d) obligation to promote the interests of the Association and to comply with the Articles of Association and the resolutions of the Association's bodies.&#x20;

3.3 If Delegates decide to join  the Association, they will henceforth, as the ATA, participate in ZKsync governance, being considered a body of the Association:&#x20;

(a) ATA members submit and vote on a proposal via the Portal, as a body of the Association, the vote of the ATA members determines the instruction to the Association's Board. Only if the ATA passes a proposal, the Association's Board will (continue to) promote and endorse the matter.

(e) As the ATA and its members act as a body of the Association, respectively within the Association's decision-making process, the Association assumes that the Association alone would be liable for the vote and actions that result from it, and not the individual members.

### 4. Termination of the membership as an extraordinary member

4.1 Membership expires upon death or, in the case of legal entities, upon loss of legal personality, voluntary resignation or exclusion. Resignation can take place at any time. The Board must be notified in writing of any resignation. This can be achieved by a Delegate affirmatively changing their membership status on its profile in the Portal.&#x20;

4.2 The exclusion of a member from the Association can be ordered by the Board due to severe violations of other membership obligations, dishonorable behavior or for other similar reasons (e.g. violation of the code of conduct).
