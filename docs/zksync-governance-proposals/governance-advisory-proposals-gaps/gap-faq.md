# GAP FAQ

### What onchain actions can I execute through a GAP?

The GovOps Governor and its timelock contract, through which Governance Advisory Proposals are submitted, are not connected to the ZKsync Protocol, the ZK Token contract or other ZKsync contracts at inception. However, proposers can still include onchain actions for Governance Advisory Proposals such as:

#### Example: Adopt SEAL Safe Harbor Agreement and enshrine agreement onchain

[GAP-2](https://vote.zknation.io/dao/proposal/35395412545014978447594654620386134175315194219985614464693911512436668500487?govId=eip155:324:0x496869a7575A1f907D1C5B1eca28e4e9E382afAb) adopted the SEAL Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement and established a rapid response mechanism that enables whitehats to effectively intervene during active exploits, safeguarding user funds and reinforcing ZKsync's proactive security measures. The agreement was registered on ZKsync Era in the Safe Harbor Registry at address 0x5f5eEc1a37F42883Df9DacdAb11985467F813877, including all adoptionDetails, ensuring transparency and immutability.&#x20;

### Do GovOps proposals always have an onchain action?

No, not always. The GovOps Governor and its timelock contract, through which Governance Advisory Proposals are submitted, are not connected to the ZKsync Protocol, the ZK Token contract or other ZKsync contracts at inception.
