# ZKsync Governance System North Star

## The Purpose of the ZKsync Governance System

ZKsync Governance System —composed of smart-contracts, interfaces like the delegation portal, and the three governance bodies— has two purposes:

1. Secure the ZKsync protocol by decentralizing control of protocol changes and improvements
2. Activate programs in service of the ZK Credo vision: Freedom —> Progress —> Prosperity

## Evaluating the Impact of ZKsync Governance Proposals

Proposals should aim to achieve goals supporting the vision of the ZK Credo. In turn, Delegates and other governance system participants should define and evaluate the impact of proposals based on each proposal’s goals and corresponding KPIs. Each KPI should be clearly related to the proposal goals, and to the purposes of the ZKsync governance system.

### _**Primary Goals and KPIs:**_

* **Secure the Protocol**: The ZKsync protocol and its assets, builders, and community, are protected from adversarial actors seeking to control the protocol for their own interests.
  * Example KPI: Number of Incidents (Objective = 0)
* **Expand Onchain Assets**: The ZKsync protocol has accessible, valuable, and diverse assets onchain, enabling a dynamic economy within and across ZK Chains.
  * Example KPI: Total value of assets available on ZKsync Chains
* **Increase Active Builders**: The ZKsync protocol has a talented, diverse, and well-funded network of active builders, accelerating the development of blockchain and ZK related solutions.
  * Example KPI: Number of projects with an FDV > $100M
* **Strengthen ZK Community**: The ZKsync protocol has an engaged, interconnected, and knowledgeable community of participants (incl. users, artists, developers, and partners). The community uses and advocates for ZKsync and ZK-technologies.
  * Example KPI: Weekly Active Addresses
