# ZKsync Proposal Guidelines

### How do I submit a ZKsync governance proposal?

Proposals are submitted onchain on the [ZKsync Governance Portal](https://vote.zknation.io/dao) (via Tally) or on other applications connected to ZKsync governance contracts.

To submit a proposal, Delegates must meet the proposal submission threshold of 0.1% or 21 million ZK of the total ZK token supply (21 billion). If a Delegate does not meet the threshold, or the author is not a Delegate, they can find a Delegate to sponsor and submit the proposal on their behalf. Delegate profiles can be viewed at [delegate.zknation.io](http://delegate.zknation.io).

ZKsync Governance Proposals pass a vote if delegates reach quorum, defined as 3% or 630 million ZK voting power in support of the proposal, AND have a simple majority of “For” votes (>50%). Each proposal must also be consistent with the values of the[ ZK Credo](https://docs.zknation.io/zk-nation/mission-zk-credo) and support the sustainable development of the ZKsync protocol and must not violate applicable law. Otherwise, it may be vetoed by the ZKsync Guardians or may be removed from the ZKsync governance portal.

### What should I do before submitting a proposal onchain?

Delegates should submit a proposal onchain after the idea has been shared widely with the ZKsync community. Delegates are encouraged to:

1. Refine the idea with a working group of 2-5 people.
2. Develop a draft proposal, informed through conversations and research, and post it on the [ZKsync Governance Forum](https://forum.zknation.io/) under the relevant category (will depend on proposal type).
3. Use the ZKsync Governance Forum, social media, and Delegates to gather feedback and create awareness of the proposal idea, draft, or full proposal.
4. Gather informal voting commitments from other Delegates in the ZKsync community. Delegate profiles can be viewed at [delegate.zknation.io](http://delegate.zknation.io).
5. Submit the proposal onchain via the [ZKsync Governance Portal](https://vote.zknation.io/dao), or an alternative application connected to ZKsync governance contracts.

### How do I add an onchain action to a proposal on Tally?

You can add the necessary onchain actions on Tally as part of the onchain proposal. To do so, visit the “Actions” section of the proposal creation flow on Tally. Then select “Custom action” and upload the necessary Application Binary Interface (ABI) file. The ABI file describes the methods and variables within a smart contract that are accessible and callable by external users or other smart contracts.

You can read more about Tally’s onchain actions at [docs.tally.xyz](https://docs.tally.xyz/knowledge-base/proposals/creating-proposals)

### Removal of Proposals from Portal

ZKsync governance proposals can be viewed on the ZKsync Governance Portal powered by Tally. However, some proposals may be removed and become unavailable on the portal if the proposal:

1. is deemed illegal under Austrian law
2. enables access to ZK tokens by prohibited addresses, including those associated with sanctioned entities, individuals, or jurisdictions, as well as addresses linked to illicit activities like fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, or other criminal enterprises.

Any proposal removed from the ZKsync Governance Portal powered by Tally may continue to be accessible via services not owned or managed by the ZKsync Association.
